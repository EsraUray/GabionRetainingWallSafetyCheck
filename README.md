* This open-access environment, which does not require any software, provides users with the opportunity to conduct stability analyses of gabion retaining wall (GRW) efficiently. GRWs, extensively utilized due to their cost-effectiveness, permeability, and ease of construction, necessitate detailed stability assessments to ensure safety against sliding, overturning, and overall stability failures.

* The presented tool has been developed within a Python Jupyter Notebook, offering an interactive and user-friendly platform wherein engineers, researchers, and students can perform calculations without reliance on commercial geotechnical software. Through this environment, users can:

  - Evaluate safety factors concerning sliding, overturning, and slope stability,

  - Test various GRW geometries and soil parameters expeditiously,

  - Compare results in a reproducible format,

  - Benefit from a fully open-source workflow that promotes transparency and knowledge sharing.

* These advantages enable the tool to serve not only practical engineering applications but also educational purposes, assisting civil engineering students and practitioners in gaining a better understanding of the mechanics of gabion retaining walls and their stability criteria.
* Mathematical models as surrogate model (SM) based on Full Factorial Design (FFD) were developed to check the stability assessment of GRW whose mathematical functions are provided in this file, deliver fast results with acceptable error margins.
* Details, verification analyses, and error performance evaluations are documented in the related article (see citations of the article).
* The dataset of 1,024 different wall designs, used in developing these mathematical models, incorporates the design principles, theoretical frameworks, and limit equilibrium approaches documented in the existing literature on retaining wall engineering.
